<h1>Crop Weed Prediction</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
Crop Weed Prediction is a project focused on developing an advanced solution for predicting and managing weed occurrences 
  in agricultural fields. Weeds pose a significant challenge to crop cultivation, reducing crop yields and increasing 
  reliance on chemical herbicides. By leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques, this project aims to provide accurate 
  predictions of weed occurrences and empower farmers with valuable insights for effective weed management.
Weed is an unwanted thing in agriculture. Weed uses the nutrients, water, land, and many more things that might have gone to crops. 
Which results in less production of the required crop. The farmer often uses pesticides to remove weed which is also effective but
    some pesticides may stick with crops and may cause problems for humans.
We aim to develop a system that only sprays pesticides on weed and not on the crop Which will reduce the mixing problem with crops 
    and also reduce the waste of pesticides.
